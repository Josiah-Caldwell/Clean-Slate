# Clean-Slate
The repo for the Cyber Janitors to create the Clean Slate web extension. Clean Slate does content filtering of inappropriate words for the Reddit platform. Clean Slate operates on the Teddit front-end of Reddit (https://teddit.net). Clean Slate will censor the web page title, submission title, submission content, and top level comments. Clean Slate only works on non-formatted, textual content. Clean Slate does not censor images, videos, or audio.

Clean Slate source code is primarily organized into two git branches.
1. `main`: this branch holds the source code for Clean Slate web extension and front end
2. `backend`: this branch holds the source code for Clean Slate back end on the AWS platform.
